HW 5
================

## Problem 1

load the dataset

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = 
  iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

clean the missing values

``` r
clean_missing = function(var) {
  if (is.numeric(var)) {
      var = replace_na(var, mean(var, na.rm = TRUE))
  } else if (is.character(var)) {
      var = replace_na(var, "virginicia")
  }
}

iris_without_missing = vector("list", length = 5)

iris_without_missing = map_df(iris_with_missing, clean_missing)
```

## Problem 2

create a dataframe containing all file names

``` r
study = list.files("./data")
```

create a function to read the file

``` r
read_data = function(filenames) {
  data_path = "./data/"
  read_csv(file = str_c(data_path, filenames))
}
```

create a dataframe for the experiment data

``` r
study_df = 
  map(study, read_data) %>% 
  bind_rows()
```

  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "data"
  )
```

## Problem 3

create a function

``` r
sim_regression = function(beta0 = 2, beta1) {
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(30, 0, 1),
    y = beta0 + beta1*x + rnorm(30, 0, 50)
  )
  
  p_value = 
    lm(y ~ x, data = sim_data) %>% 
    broom::tidy()
}
```

set beta1 = 0 and generate 10000 datasets from the model

``` r
sim_results = 
  rerun(1000, sim_regression(beta1 = 0)) %>% 
  bind_rows()
```

Repeat the above for beta1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6}

``` r
sim_results = 
  tibble(beta1_value = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = beta1_value, ~rerun(1000, sim_regression(beta1 = .x))),
    estimate_dfs = map(output_lists, bind_rows)
  ) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_dfs)
```

The first plot

``` r
sim_results %>% 
  filter(term == "x") %>% 
  mutate(decision = ifelse(p.value > 0.05, "not_reject", "reject")) %>% 
  count(beta1_value, decision) %>% 
  group_by(beta1_value) %>% 
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  filter(decision == "reject") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beta1_value, y = proportion)) +
  geom_point()
```
