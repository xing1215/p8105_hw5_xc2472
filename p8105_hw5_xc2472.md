HW 5
================

## Problem 1

load the dataset

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = 
  iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

clean the missing values

``` r
clean_missing = function(var) {
  if (is.numeric(var)) {
      var = replace_na(var, mean(var, na.rm = TRUE))
  } else if (is.character(var)) {
      var = replace_na(var, "virginicia")
  }
}

iris_without_missing = vector("list", length = 5)

iris_without_missing = map_df(iris_with_missing, clean_missing)
```

## Problem 2

create a dataframe containing all file names

``` r
study = list.files("./data")
```

create a function to read the file

``` r
read_data = function(filenames) {
  data_path = "./data/"
  read_csv(file = str_c(data_path, filenames))
}
```

create a dataframe for the experiment data

``` r
study_df = map_df(study, read_data)
```
